This is a big-number library for Lua. It is based on the arbitrary precision
library MAPM 4.3 written by Michael C. Ring and available at
http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ringx004/mapm-main.html .

To install, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and MAPM.
Then run "make test".

  mapmlib.c       Lua binding for mapm
  test.lua        test code
  test2.lua       test code
  tm.lua          tag method interface for mapm binding
